## Content-Based Movie Recommendation Systems
Content-based methods are based on the similarity of movie attributes. Using this type of recommender system, if a user watches one movie, similar movies are recommended. For example, if a user watches a comedy movie starring Adam Sandler, the system will recommend them movies in the same genre or starring the same actor, or both. With this in mind, the input for building a content-based recommender system is movie attributes.
The details of the movies(title, genre, runtime, rating, poster, etc) are fetched from kaggle,https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv
## Similarity Score :
How does it decide which item is most similar to the item user likes? Here we use the similarity scores.
It is a numerical value ranges between zero to one which helps to determine how much two items are similar to each other on a scale of zero to one. This similarity score is obtained measuring the similarity between the text details of both of the items. So, similarity score is the measure of similarity between given text details of two items. This can be done by cosine-similarity.
